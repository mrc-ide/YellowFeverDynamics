This version (0.2) of the YellowFeverDynamics package is a supplement to version 0.2 of the [YEP package](https://mrc-ide.github.io/YEP/index.html), used for running alternate versions of the standard SEIRV yellow fever transmission model contained in that package for specific tasks.

Please see the documentation for YEP for details of the standard model.
