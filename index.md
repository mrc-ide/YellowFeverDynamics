The package can also be used to fit values of epidemiological parameters of the model to different types of data on yellow fever burden in one or more regions.

For a more detailed overview of the purpose and uses of the package, please read the [Introduction](https://mrc-ide.github.io/YellowFeverDynamics/articles/A1Introduction.html) article.
